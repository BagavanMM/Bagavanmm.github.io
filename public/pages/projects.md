### [PeroxyBio: Designing Enzymes to Increase Red Blood Cell Shelf Life](https://www.notion.so/PeroxyBio-Designing-Enzymes-to-Increase-Red-Blood-Cell-Shelf-Life-4146ab495f544a508c9a37b5cd228780) ðŸ”—

- Problem: More than 4.5 millionÂ patients need blood transfusions each year in the US. In the US, 114 thousand pints of blood expire due to shelf life and are unable to reach patients. Why? Because the hemoglobin in the blood oxidizes faster in storage than in vivo
- Idea: Use Rosetta3 (A De novo enzyme design algorithm) to design an enzyme that can neutralize the effects of oxidization in the hemoglobin to increase shelf life
- The winning idea for a 24-hour hackathon sprint hosted by The Knowledge Society

### [brAInstorm: Visualizing the art of Emotion](https://devpost.com/software/brainstorm-2qkdtw) ðŸ”—

- Idea: Generating art that reflects your mood based on your brainwaves
    - Stable Diffusion to generate the Art
    - an OpenBCI EEG Headset to collect your brainwaves
    - Used Flask for backend and HTML/CSS for front-end
- HacktheNorth 2022 Finalist Idea (Canadaâ€™s Largest Hackathon)

### [NPyNN](https://github.com/BagavanMM/NPynn) ðŸ”—

- A deep learning framework built in Python that people can use to perofrm classification and regression (functions similar to Keras)
- Applied first-principles thinking to breakdown the math behind how neural networks work and implemented it in Numpy (a python library mainly used for itâ€™s built-in math functions).

### **[Off-Wind: Adaptive Off-Shore Wind Turbines using 3D and 4D Printing](http://off-wind.github.io)** ðŸ”—

- Research project about leveraging 3D and 4D printing to create adaptive off-shore wind turbines, specifically mimicking the structure of plant leaf veins
- This radical solution would provide a 7.8x increase in efficiency, reduce costs by over $5M for each wind turbine, and create the opportunity to repurpose land for other tasks
- Contributed to aÂ [research paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nAumOk37vXRurp2GDQ_vPK-dCmWZ1MrS/view?usp=sharing)Â going technically deep into the problem and solution (along with building aÂ [website](https://off-wind.github.io/),Â [one-pager](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/tks-life-prod.appspot.com/o/items%2F9thVwN6TVzSxezp0UPNb4B704ON2%2FOffWind%20Energy.pdf?alt=media&token=26c64000-ee24-4907-8305-381328a44eb1), and Blender mock-ups)
- Won best presentation, peopleâ€™s choice, and best overall awards at The Knowledge Societyâ€™s moonshot pitch competition, presenting to over 200 people

### [Empowering Girls in Kenya into the Digital Economy](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/tks-life-prod.appspot.com/o/items%2Fbagavan.marakathalingasivam%2FEmpowering%20Women%20and%20Girls%20in%20the%20Digital%20Economy%20(Meru%2C%20Kenay)%20-%20Aman%2C%20Bagava%2C%20Sambhav%2C%20Yameen.pdf?alt=media&token=364f0f4d-91a3-4fea-be96-78afad12b3d9) ðŸ”—

- A consulting challenge hosted by the United Nations and The Knowledge Society, where we were given 4 weeks to see how we can enable more women and girls into the digital economy by 2026
- Our proposal: UFem Academy - a platform that enables girls to learn the skills necessary to enter the digital economy, funded through a microfinance system.

## Genomics Projects ðŸ§¬

### [Protein-Specific De Novo Drug Design using RL and Transformers](https://www.notion.so/Protein-Specific-De-Novo-Drug-Design-with-Transformers-5f596908e1fd4b239a47fda74825ac88) ðŸ”—

- A lot of de novo drug design methods require some form of prior knowledge/constraints as input, such as protein binders, different physiochemical characteristics, etc. This not only limits our modelâ€™s creativity, but it can also be inefficient.
- The idea: Using Transformers and RL we can design effective drugs without priori knowledge, and instead with just the target protein amino acid sequence.
- Currently improving accuracy (~80% of generated drugs were valid, which is good but isnâ€™t good enough to compete with status quo) so that I could test it out in a lab

### [Implementation of T-GEM: A Transformer for Gene Expression Modelling](https://github.com/BagavanMM/Transformer-for-Gene-Expression-Modeling) ðŸ”—

- Implementation of the "[Transformer for Gene Expression Modeling (T-GEM): An Interpretable Deep Learning Model for Gene Expression-Based Phenotype Predictions](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/14/19/4763)" paper
- Model was built and trained with PyTorch + SKLearn, and Numpy + Pandas for data preprocessing

### [Sequence Alignment Algorithms](https://github.com/BagavanMM/Sequence-Alignment-Algorithms) ðŸ”—

- Collection of different sequence alignment algorithms implemented in python
- Most of the algorithms implemented as exercises from this [textbook](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.047/f15/MIT6_047F15_Compiled.pdf)

## Neuro-Related Projects ðŸ§

### **[Generating Music from Brainwaves using BCIs](https://github.com/BagavanMM/BrainwaveMusic-OpenBCI)** ðŸ”—

- Used OpenBCIâ€™s Ganglion Board + Headband kit to collect electrical activity from the brain, then built a program (python) to convert it into music
- Main libraries used: Brainflow, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and MidiUtil

### [EMG-Pong: Playing Pong without a Keyboard](https://github.com/BagavanMM/EMG-Pong)ðŸ”—

- A simple project that uses EMG sensors on each of my arms to play the game pong - whenever I flex one of my arms the paddle will move either up or down
- Hardware: OpenBCIâ€™s Ganglion Board + EMG Sticky Electrodes

### [Using Deep-Convolutional GANs to Improve SSVEP Classification Systems](https://github.com/BagavanMM/EEG-DCGAN) ðŸ”—
