# Overview

## Hey, Iâ€™m Bagavan ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a 16 y/o machine learning developer based in Toronto, who spends most of my time solving hard problems, building cool projects and learning about the world around me. Most of the work Iâ€™ve done stems back to my interest in AI and how we can apply this tool to solve problems within many other fields (whether thatâ€™d be to better understand the human genome or see how we can build better tools to analyze the brain). I found that exposure to deep tech has enabled me to take action and solve global problems, whether thatâ€™s from maternal mortality to climate change.

## What Iâ€™ve Recently Been Up-To

**************************************************************Deep Learning x Computational Genomics************************************************************** 

Iâ€™ve spent the last four months applying my existing knowledge of AI to the computational genomics space. My most recent project was [using transformers and reinforcement learning for protein-specific de novo drug design](https://www.notion.so/Protein-Specific-De-Novo-Drug-Design-with-Transformers-5f596908e1fd4b239a47fda74825ac88) (i.e., seeing if we can design novel drugs from scratch with just the target amino acid sequence as input).

Other projects Iâ€™ve worked on:

- Neutralizing the effects of H2O2 and Fe(III) in red blood cells to increase shelf life using de novo enzyme design (Rosetta3) - [Memo](https://www.notion.so/PeroxyBio-Designing-Enzymes-to-Increase-Red-Blood-Cell-Shelf-Life-4146ab495f544a508c9a37b5cd228780)
- Cancer-related phenotype prediction with T-GEM (A transformer model for gene expression modelling) - [Code](https://github.com/BagavanMM/Transformer-for-Gene-Expression-Modeling/)
